# vex

**vex** is a client for the `[nex:// protocol](https://nex.nightfall.city/warp.php)`.

## But why?

This serves as an exercise to learn the [V programming language](https://vlang.io).

## Dependencies

There are no build time dependencies other than a functioning V build environment (V compiler, V standard library).

## Build

`v .`

## Usage

```bash
./vex nex://your.nex.hostname.com/path/to/your/file.txt 
```
